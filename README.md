# Twist Open Source Code

## üü¶ What's Twist?

Twist is a website which aims to have the same functionalities of modern social networks but in a retro style, originally it was created for a challenge between friends with Rayanis55 where it had to compete with Plot (Never create), but Rayanis55 ended up joining the projects and we abandoned the idea of challenging each other

## üåê Why make the projects open source?

We think that making the Twist project open source will allow anyone to use certain systems (such as connection, posts, etc.) in their website or use CSS for their website.
